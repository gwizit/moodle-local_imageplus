## Installation

### Method 1: Via Moodle Plugin Installer (Recommended)

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator
3. Go to **Site administration** → **Plugins** → **Install plugins**
4. Upload the ZIP file
5. **If prompted** with "Unable to detect the plugin type":
   - Select **"Local plugin (local)"** from the "Plugin type" dropdown
   - Confirm the plugin folder name shows as **"imageplus"**
6. Click "Install plugin from the ZIP file"
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation

**Note**: Some Moodle installations require manual plugin type selection for security. This is normal behavior.

### Method 2: Manual Installation (If ZIP upload fails)

**Recommended if you get "corrupted_archive_structure" error:**

1. Extract the plugin ZIP file
2. Copy the `imageplus` folder to `[moodle-root]/local/`
3. Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator
4. Navigate to **Site administration** → **Notifications**
5. Click **"Upgrade Moodle database now"**
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation

**Tip**: On Windows, you can use the included `manual_install.ps1` helper script.

### Method 3: Via Command Line

```bash
cd [moodle-root]/local/
git clone [repository-url] imageplus
cd [moodle-root]
php admin/cli/upgrade.php
```

### Post-Installation: Clear Caches

**IMPORTANT:** After installing or updating the plugin, always clear Moodle's caches:

**Method 1: Via Web Interface**
1. Go to **Site administration** → **Development** → **Purge all caches**
2. Click "Purge all caches" button

**Method 2: Via Command Line (Faster)**
```bash
php admin/cli/purge_caches.php
```

**Why?** Moodle caches language strings. If you don't clear caches, you might see text displayed as `[[stringname]]` instead of the actual text. This is normal Moodle behavior for all plugins.

---

## Configuration

After installation, configure the plugin defaults:

1. Go to **Site administration** → **Plugins** → **Local plugins** → **ImagePlus**
2. Configure the following settings:
   - **Default search term**: Default term to search for in filenames
   - **Default execution mode**: Preview or Execute (Preview recommended for safety)
   - **Preserve permissions by default**: Keep original file permissions
   - **Search database by default**: Include Moodle's file storage
   - **Search file system by default**: Include file system directories

---

## Usage

### Accessing the Tool

1. Log in as a **site administrator** (requires `moodle/site:config` capability)
2. Go to **Site administration** → **Server** → **ImagePlus**

**Note:** Non-administrators will see an access denied error. This is intentional for security.

### Using the Multi-Step Wizard

#### Step 1: Define Search Criteria

1. **Enter Search Term**: Type the text pattern to search for in filenames
   - Simple text: `logo`, `banner`, `icon`
   - Wildcards: `logo*` (finds logo.png, logo-2024.jpg), `banner?.png` (finds banner1.png, banner2.png)
   
2. **Select File Type**: Choose what type of files to search for
   - Images (JPG, PNG, WebP)
   - PDF documents
   - ZIP archives
   - Documents (DOC, DOCX, ODT, TXT)
   - Videos (MP4, AVI, MOV, WebM)
   - Audio (MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A)

3. **Choose Search Locations**:
   - ☑️ **Include database files**: Search Moodle's file storage system
   - ☑️ **Include file system**: Search Moodle installation directories

4. Click **Find matching files** to proceed to Step 2

#### Step 2: Select Files to Replace

1. **Review Found Files**: See all files matching your search criteria
   - Filesystem files show full path and filename
   - Database files show filename, ID, size, and context

2. **Select Files**: 
   - Use checkboxes to select specific files to replace
   - Use **Select All/Deselect All** buttons for bulk selection
   - You can select from both filesystem and database results

3. **Navigation**:
   - Click **Back** to modify search criteria
   - Click **Next** to proceed to replacement options

**Note:** At least one file must be selected to proceed.

#### Step 3: Replacement Options and Confirmation

1. **Upload Replacement File**: 
   - Select the file that will replace all selected files
   - Maximum file size: 50MB
   - **Important**: File extension must match target files (unless cross-format is enabled for images)

2. **Configure Options**:
   - ☑️ **Preserve file permissions**: Keep original file permissions when replacing
   - **Execution mode**: 
     - **Preview only**: See what would be changed without modifying files (safe - recommended first)
     - **Execute changes**: Actually perform the replacements
   
3. **Image-Specific Options** (only shown for images when GD library is available):
   - ☑️ **Allow cross-format image replacement**: Enable JPG↔PNG↔WebP conversion

4. **Backup Confirmation** ⚠️:
   - ☑️ **I confirm that a recent backup has been made** (REQUIRED)
   - This checkbox must be checked before proceeding
   - Replacement operations cannot be undone

5. **Final Warning**: Read the warning about irreversible changes

6. Click **Execute Replacement** to complete the operation

### After Execution

- View detailed results showing success/failure for each file
- Review replacement log with statistics
- Click **Start Over** to begin a new replacement operation
- Consider clearing Moodle caches after replacements

### Directories Scanned

The plugin searches the following Moodle directories:
- `theme/` - Theme images
- `pix/` - Moodle icons and graphics
- `mod/` - Module images
- `blocks/` - Block images
- `local/` - Local customizations
- `course/` - Course images
- `user/` - User images
- `backup/` - Backup files
- `repository/` - Repository files
- Root directory (non-recursive)

---

## How It Works

1. **Search Phase**: The plugin scans selected locations for images containing your search term
2. **Analysis**: For each matching image, it determines:
   - Current format (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
   - Current dimensions (width × height)
   - File location (file system or database)
3. **Replacement**: The source image is:
   - Resized to match the target dimensions
   - Converted to match the target format
   - Saved with preserved permissions (if enabled)
4. **Database Updates**: For database files:
   - New content hash is calculated
   - File records are updated in Moodle's files table
   - File storage structure is maintained
5. **Logging**: All operations are logged for audit purposes

---

## Permissions

The plugin defines two capabilities and requires site administrator access:

- **`moodle/site:config`**: **REQUIRED** - Site administrator permission (checked before any access)
- **`local/imageplus:view`**: View the ImagePlus tool
- **`local/imageplus:manage`**: Perform file replacement operations

**Security Note:** Only users with site administrator permissions can access this plugin. Non-administrators will see an error message directing them to contact their site administrator.

---

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Site administrator-only access (`moodle/site:config` capability required)
- Multiple permission checks throughout the workflow
- Session key verification on all form submissions
- Confirm session key on destructive operations (Step 3)

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user input validated and sanitized by Moodle form API
- File paths validated with `PARAM_PATH` to prevent directory traversal
- Database file IDs validated as integers with `PARAM_INT`
- File existence and location verification before processing
- Filenames sanitized with `clean_filename()` function

### Output Protection
- All displayed content escaped with `s()` function to prevent XSS
- JavaScript strings escaped with `addslashes_js()`
- HTML output uses Moodle's `html_writer` class
- File paths and names sanitized before display

### File Type Validation
- Comprehensive mimetype checking for all file types:
  - Images: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`
  - PDFs: `application/pdf`
  - Archives: `application/zip`, `application/x-zip-compressed`
  - Documents: `application/msword`, `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`, etc.
  - Videos: `video/mp4`, `video/avi`, `video/quicktime`, `video/webm`
  - Audio: `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/ogg`, `audio/mp4`
- Upload validation ensures file type matches selected category

### Directory Traversal Prevention
- Filesystem paths validated with `realpath()` and `strpos()` checks
- Files must be within Moodle's `$CFG->dirroot`
- File existence verified before processing
- Invalid paths are rejected

### Mandatory Backup Confirmation
- Checkbox confirmation required before executing replacements
- Warning message displayed about irreversible operations
- User must acknowledge backup has been made

## Best Practices

### Safety First
1. ✅ Always run in **Preview mode** first to see what will be changed
2. ✅ **BACKUP YOUR MOODLE DATA** before running replacements
3. ✅ Use the backup confirmation checkbox consciously - it's there for a reason
4. ✅ Test with a specific search term on a small set of files first
5. ✅ Review the file selection list carefully in Step 2 before proceeding
6. ✅ Consider running a test on a staging/development environment first

### Performance
1. ⚡ For large sites, search database OR file system separately (don't check both)
2. ⚡ Use specific search terms to limit the number of matches
3. ⚡ Run operations during low-traffic periods
4. ⚡ Process files in smaller batches if you have many matches
5. ⚡ Increase PHP memory limit for large file operations

### Image Quality
1. 🎨 Use high-quality source images that scale well
2. 🎨 Source images should ideally be larger than or equal to target images
3. 🎨 For transparent images, use PNG or WebP source format
4. 🎨 JPEG is best for photographs, PNG for graphics with transparency
5. 🎨 Test cross-format conversion on a few files before bulk operations

### Workflow
1. 📋 **Step 1**: Start with specific search terms, then broaden if needed
2. 📋 **Step 2**: Carefully review and select only the files you intend to replace
3. 📋 **Step 3**: Always check "Preview mode" first, then run again in "Execute mode"
4. 📋 Document what you've changed for future reference
5. 📋 Clear Moodle caches after completing replacements

## Requirements

### Moodle Requirements
- **Moodle version**: 4.3 to 5.1+ (fully tested and compatible)
- **PHP version**: 7.4 or higher (8.0+ recommended)

### PHP Extensions
- **GD Library** (recommended but not required)
  - Required for: Image resizing and cross-format conversion (JPG↔PNG↔WebP)
  - Without GD: Images can still be replaced with exact same format
  - With GD: Full image processing including resizing and format conversion
  - Optional: WebP support for WebP image handling

### Server Requirements
- Write permissions to Moodle's `dataroot/filedir` directory
- Sufficient PHP memory limit (128MB minimum, 256MB+ recommended for images)
- PHP `max_execution_time` sufficient for batch operations

---

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Found
- Check that search term matches filenames (try using wildcards like `logo*`)
- Verify you have selected the correct file type filter
- Verify you have selected the correct search locations
- Ensure files are in supported formats for the selected file type

### GD Library Not Available
- **Symptom**: Warning displayed on main page
- **Impact**: Image cross-format conversion disabled (JPG→JPG only, PNG→PNG only)
- **Solution**: Ask system administrator to install PHP GD extension
- **Workaround**: Replace images with exact same format only

### Extension Mismatch Error
- **Symptom**: "Extension mismatch: pdf file cannot replace jpg files"
- **Cause**: Trying to replace PDF with JPG, or vice versa
- **Solution**: Upload a file with the same extension as target files
- **Note**: Images can cross-convert if "Allow cross-format" is enabled and GD is available

### Permission Denied Errors
- Verify you have the `local/imageplus:manage` capability
- Check file system permissions on Moodle directories
- Ensure web server has write access to target directories

### Memory Errors
- Increase PHP memory limit in php.ini
- Process fewer files at once
- Use selective checkboxes to process files in batches
- Use lower quality source images (for image files)

### No Files Selected Error
- **Symptom**: Alert when clicking "Replace selected files"
- **Cause**: No checkboxes are selected
- **Solution**: Check at least one file to replace

### WebP Not Supported
- Install PHP WebP extension
- Use JPEG or PNG as source format instead
- Check with `php -i | grep -i webp` to verify WebP support
